# Eye tracking Fix
> if you have the Pimax Eye tracking module, and you are not satisfied with how it performs. use this instead! it increases performance (a little bit) i am still working out the bugs and kinks in it. but for the most part, it does improve the eye tracking

# Instructons

> install pimax eye tracking software like usual. !!download the entire set of files!! update the firmware from step 1 in the files, run the runtime.exe then check to see if it matches the settings in amcap (pictures provided) after that is installed replace the files with the ones in lib (image is provided for instructions)

# if you are having a hard time getting to calibrate. make sure AMcap is closed, if you are still having a hard time calibrating, kill AseeVr with task manager, and kill forward with task manager. hold down powerbutton on the HMD until it shuts off wait 30 seconds, turn it back on, restart AseeVR and try again. (might have to repeat multiple times) if it still doesnt work, open device manager, and uninstall the DroolonF1 (located in cameras) and re install everything. restart computer. and try again
