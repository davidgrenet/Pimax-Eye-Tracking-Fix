# Eye tracking Fix
> if you have the Pimax Eye tracking module, and you are not satisfied with how it performs. use this instead! it increases performance (a little bit) i am still working out the bugs and kinks in it. but for the most part, it does improve the eye tracking

# Instructons

> install pimax eye tracking software like usual. !!download the entire set of files!! update the firmware from step 1 in the files, run the runtime.exe then check to see if it matches the settings in amcap (pictures provided) after that is installed replace the files with the ones in lib (image is provided for instructions)
