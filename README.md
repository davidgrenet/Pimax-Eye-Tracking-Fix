# Eye tracking Fix
> if you have the Pimax Eye tracking module, and you are not satisfied with how it performs. use this instead! it increases performance (a little bit) i am still working out the bugs and kinks in it. but for the most part, it does improve the eye tracking

# Instructons

> install pimax eye tracking software like usual. !!download the entire set of files!! update the firmware from step 1 in the files, run the runtime.exe then check to see if it matches the settings in amcap (pictures provided) after that is installed replace the files with the ones in lib (image is provided for instructions)

make sure you are using the ET on 2.0 mode where it is connected directly to the headset. there is no longer a need for an external cable with this new fix

# if you are having a hard time getting to calibrate. make sure AMcap is closed, if you are still having a hard time calibrating, kill AseeVr with task manager, and kill forward with task manager. hold down powerbutton on the HMD until it shuts off wait 30 seconds, turn it back on, restart AseeVR and try again. (might have to repeat multiple times) if it still doesnt work, open device manager, and uninstall the DroolonF1 (located in cameras) and re install everything. restart computer. and try again.

make sure you are using the AMCap located in the files downloaded. on the right hand side you will see a button called capture. click that, then in the dropdown click set frame rate. under that, make sure the box is checked, and type in "10000" (without the quotes) and make sure that is applied. also make sure to follow the amcap instructions to change it to the default resolution + frames. it should show similar to the image in step 3. any questions? feel free to shoot me a dm on discord @guppyexpress#0001
